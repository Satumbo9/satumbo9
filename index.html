          Edimarf Satumbo is an Angolan-born professional who has a deep passion
          for both technology and business. In 2015, Edimarf moved to Budapest
          to pursue higher education at ELTE University, where he completed a
          degree in Computer Science in 2021. This technical foundation sparked
          a keen interest in web development and other facets of the tech
          industry. After graduating, Edimarf decided to expand his expertise by
          pursuing a degree in International Business and Economy, driven by his
          entrepreneurial spirit and a passion for business strategy. This
          combination of technical knowledge and business acumen has given him a
          unique skill set, allowing him to navigate both industries with ease.
          Throughout his journey, Edimarf has lived in various places, including
          Miami and Arizona, where he embraced a nomadic lifestyle, often
          finding accommodation with existing community members. His
          adaptability and drive to connect with diverse cultures and
          professionals reflect his open-minded and forward-thinking approach to
          life. With his diverse academic background and hands-on experience,
          Edimarf continues to explore opportunities in web development while
          maintaining a strong focus on business ventures. He remains committed
          to personal growth and is always looking for new ways to combine his
          two passions.
